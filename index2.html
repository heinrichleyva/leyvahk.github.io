I cannot imagine my life without you and I wouldn't have spent it any other way. You make all the hardships in life bearable and I would like to thank you for that. I wish I have done the same thing for you and I am sorry if I have caused you pain or confusion at times and I will make it up to you. Thank you for everything.</font></p>
